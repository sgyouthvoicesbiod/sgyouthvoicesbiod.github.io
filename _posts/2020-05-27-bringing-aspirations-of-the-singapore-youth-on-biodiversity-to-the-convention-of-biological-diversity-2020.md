<p>Hi guys, in case you’re wondering whether your efforts at the consultations meant anything, well it very much did. The Global Youth Biodiversity Network (GYBN) mentioned Singapore was the strongest on transformative education in the Aspirations which we wrote together. We emphasized on teaching youths about biodiversity through environmental education.</p>

<p>Just recently, GYBN participated in the UN Convention on Biological Diversity Open Ended Working Group 2 meeting. We updated the Executive Secretary, countries and stakeholders at the consultations on how much Singapore is very much involved in the process. GYBN gave us, the Singapore Youths, the honour to push for a standalone target on transformative education in the framework for post-2020 Biodiversity. It was because of you guys, we managed to do this!</p>
