<p>Hello Friends of the Environment, today has been a special day for SYVB. We were featured in <a href="https://www.ricemedia.co/dover-will-clementi-forest-next-chopping-board/">RICE</a> and gave a presentation for 'Biome-Diversity' organized by Sustainable Singapore Gallery. We reached about 60 participants on Zoom and 124 views (and counting) on Facebook! Here was some of the feedback:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<ul>
<li><em>"It was presented in a very fun engaging manner and I had learnt a lot. Wish to attend more such talks by them"</em></li>
<li><em>"It was educational and made me want to learn more!"</em></li>
<li><em>"I learnt about many things through the slides and the questions and i was inspired to save more animals, and care more for them!  :)"</em></li>
</ul>
