title: SYVB's participation in external engagements
---

<p>This word map created by the "Emerging Stronger Conversation: Youth Aspirations for a Sustainable City in Nature" taskforce and participants reflects a wonderful summary of what youths truly care.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Thanks to the taskforce's organizers and facilitators, SYVB and other environment youth groups had a great opportunity today to share and discuss environmental matters close to our hearts. Education, collaboration, empowerment, stewardship and innovation were just some of the ideas brought up. Many key stakeholders in government were also there to listen to our views.</p>

<p>SYVB also participated in the recent Biodiversity Roundtable meeting and received positive feedback from its members.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Maybe for future conversations and activities, we shall delve into topics that are hardly discussed such as development, policies or resource consumption beyond education, plastics and awareness. That way, we can aim to build a true Sustainable City in Nature.</p>
