<p>Can't believe we did it again. The first 'Singapore Youth Voices for Biodiversity' event held today! A stepping stone to more focus group consultations haha! It took a remarkable group of passionate individuals who believe in the importance of Biodiversity to gather together to discuss new ideas! It was a challenge to inform people about the CBD and how it relates to us in Singapore. Nonetheless, we managed to pull it off. We hope the rest in ASEAN and Asia MAB YOUTH FORUM 2019 for Asian and Pacific Participants can conduct theirs soon! All the best!</p>
