<p>Last month, members from SYVB and LepakInSG attended the public viewing on the Environmental Impact Study for the Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) Waterfront Project. We consolidated our responses and presented them to RWS. Hopefully, we can support organizations to conserve Singapore's remaining ecosystems and help Singapore truly become a 'City in Nature' for both terrestrial and marine habitats.</p>
