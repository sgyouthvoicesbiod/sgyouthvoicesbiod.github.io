<p>Did you know that there are two exciting international observances days next week? On Wednesday 20 May we are celebrating World Bee Day, and on Friday 22 May it's International Day of Biodiversity! Hence, the Global Youth Biodiversity Network designated next week as the International Day of Biodiversity Week. The GYBN and its youth groups all around the world are celebrating by providing various online materials for you and your friends to learn more about biodiversity. </p>
