title: Habitat Enhancement at Telok Blangah
---

Today, the SYVB coordinators decided to take a break from writing to do some forest habitat enhancement at Telok Blangah for this year's Festival of Biodiversity.

This is the first native tree (Gutta-percha) we planted as a team to celebrate our first-year anniversary. This young tree serves a reminder for us to continue empowering the next generation of youths to have voice for our biodiversity.
