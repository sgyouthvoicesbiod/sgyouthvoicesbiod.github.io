<p>SYVB is thankful to be listed as an example of youth activism in Singapore by NMP Anthea Ong during her Adjournment Motion Speech on the 7 Oct 2019. The article <a href="https://medium.com/@antheaindiraong/youth-activism-how-loving-singapore-looks-like-54b610781a0">"Youth Activisim: What Loving Singapore Looks Like"</a> highlighted the concerns of young people on the future of our nation. As a youth group, we managed to bring the voices of youth to the United Nations Convention of Biological Diversity, proving that youths are actively shaping our Singapore and all its biodiversity.</p>
